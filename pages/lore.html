                    Cold is better than dead. Dead is better than cursed. Cursed is better that whatever the rest of the world south of the lakes is. No one remembers what happened or when it happened, but it happened, and the world was scortched. Someone said it wasn't magic,
                    some agreed, but if it wasn't magic then it must be gods. Either way, some amount of hell was let loose and the world paid in blood. Those that were in the south apparently did not immediately die, but there haven't been trade caravans in a few hundred years.
                    Thankfully for the tribes in the north, the summers are just long enough to get the spuds out.

                    The tribes are probably the last refuge of civilization left in the world. There are great oceans to the west, east, and north. They freeze deep enough to walk on, but fishers on the coasts say you shouldn't go out on the ice. Serpents and hellbears live
                    on the ice. The lakes to the south seem like oceans, but the water is drinkable, so we know they're different and not connected. The forests have been thinned enough to make roads between the settlements, but everyone knows not to stray too far from the roads.
                    The furthest south, on the islands, there are few trees left since they were cut for boats. According to the night watchers, it'd be better not to see out at night.

                    At some point, we got restless. The harvests were fine, the tools were repaired and the walls were maintained. But we were restless. Being young would do that, we were told, but knowing before hand didn't make it easier. We had some skills, we had a lot of
                    confidence, and we knew that we wanted more out of life. We heard stories of grand "vagabonding" our great grandparents used to have. It was a right of passage in our culture, but it had been years since anyone had actually done one. The village elder, Oomi,
                    told us stories of how she and a few friends had gone to the northern ocean, and tasted its waters. She told us we could do it too, if we wanted to. Nane told us his great great grandfather had gone off with a trade caravan and seen the lands south of the lakes.
                    These stories were too much to hear and not dream of. So we did dream, and then, we took action.

                    Frost still covered the ground, but the undertone of the air had a hint of sweet to it. Early spring we guessed was as good a time as any to set off on an adventure. Our first stop would take us to the settlement of Gokal. From there, we could hire a boat to the
                    islands. And from there, we could be the first of our tribe in a few hundred years to step foot on the lands south of the lakes.
